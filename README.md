## Introduction

Our purpose is simple. We want to make spatial analysis accessible to everyone.

What does that mean? GIS is complex and requires specialized knowledge. There are only about 2 million people in the world that work as GIS professionals, while billions of users depend on information with a location component. 

And that’s what we’re going to change. We want to empower everyone, especially any office worker who depends on IT tools, to build what they need themselves. Quickly, simply, and inexpensively.
